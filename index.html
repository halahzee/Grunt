                        Grunt is a JavaScript task runner, a tool used to automatically perform frequent tasks such as
                        minification, compilation, unit testing, and linting.
                        It uses a command-line interface to run custom tasks defined in a file (known as a Gruntfile).
                        Grunt was created by Ben Alman in 2012 and is written in Node.

                        This software is older than Gulp and WebPack, its released in 2012

                    <p> Grunt is a tool that allows us to automatically run any set of tasks. Grunt can even wait while you code, pick up changes made to your source code files (CSS, HTML, or JavaScript) and then execute a pre-configured set of tasks every time you save your changes. This way, you are no longer required to manually execute a set of commands in order for the changes to take effect. Grunt does this by wrapping these
                        processes up into tasks.</p>

                        Enforce your coding style guides for uniformity and readability throughout your project’s code base.<br>
                        Compile your CSS from your preprocessor of choice (e.g. Sass and Less).<br>

                    <p>
                        Gulp is a cross-platform, streaming task runner that lets developers automate many development
                        tasks. At a high level, gulp reads files as streams and pipes the streams to different tasks.
                        These tasks are code-based and use plugins. The tasks modify the files, building source files
                        into production files.

                    <p>Gulp Helps to run front-end tasks and large-scale web applications. Gulp builds system automated
                        tasks like CSS and HTML minification, concatenating library files, and compiling the SASS files.
                        These tasks can be run using Shell or Bash scripts on the command line.</p>

                    <p>Webpack is module bundler, it is a tool that lets you compile JavaScript modules, also known as module bundler. Given a
                        large number of files, it generates a single file (or a few files) that run your app. It can
                        perform many operations: helps you bundle your resources.</p>

                    <p>
                        WebPack offers more flexibility and advanced functionality for modern front-end projects. It
                        comes with a functional core and can be extended using particular loaders and plugins.
                        Essentially it is used for bundling JavaScript modules with dependencies into files, but for
                        complex JavaScript applications with lots of non-code assets (images, fonts, CSS, etc.) it can
                        provide great benefits.

                        Can run Babel transpilation to ES5, allowing you to use the Latest JavaScript features without
                        worrying about browser support.<br>
                        Can convert inline images to data URIs.<br>
                        Allows you to use require() for CSS files.<br>
                        Can run a development webserver.<br>
                        Can handle hot module replacement.<br>
                        Can split the output files into multiple files, to avoid having a huge js file to load in the
                        first page hit.<br>
                        Can perform tree shaking( removing “dead code” from the bundle).<br>
